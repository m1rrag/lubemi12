Software project:
Emily Lubar lubemi12@evergeen.edu
Nat Sheppard shenat26@evergreen.edu

Week 1 Goal: Get through at least 50% of the Python tutorial

Hardware project
Emily Lubar lubemi12@evergeen.edu
Claude Silveira silmar08@evergreen.edu
Kaila Marfori markai14@evergreen.edu
Cliff Randolph rancli11@evergreen.edu
Tyler Logan logtyl02@evergreen.edu

Goal: read chapters 1-2 of Arduino Workshop

Group goal: meet and figure out project (sunday at 1 in computer lab) Decide: pieces/budget
Ideas: color to sound, temperature to sound, motion sensor...
